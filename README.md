    <p>The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin for the United States Air Force. It was the first known fifth generation aircraft. Known for its superior speed, agility, and advanced avionics, the F-22 is designed to achieve air dominance and operate undetected in hostile environments. It is feared by many and some of its features are not fully revealed. It has large amounts of stealth capabilities, making it a perfect weapon against enemies. This page highlights the key characteristics that make the F-22 one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The F-22 Raptor is equipped with a large array of weapons designed to ensure air superiority and precision strike capabilities. It houses a M61A2 Vulcan 20mm Gatling gun, capable of firing up to 6,000 rounds per minute, with a capacity of approximately 480 rounds. For air-to-air engagements, the Raptor carries up to six AIM-120C Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) in its main weapons bay. Additionally, it can also accommodate two AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles in the side weapons bays, providing close-range combat capabilities. For air to ground attacks, the F-22 can carry two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) or eight 250-pound GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs), offering precision strike options against various ground targets. For extended-range operations or when stealth is less critical, the F-22 is equipped with four external hardpoints, each capable of carrying up to 2,270 kg (5,000 lbs), allowing for additional AIM-120C missiles or external fuel tanks. These weapons allow the F-22 to be one of the most feared fighter jets and a formidable opponent.</p>

    <p>The F-22 Raptor’s technological edge also lies in its unmatched stealth capabilities and cutting-edge systems that make it nearly invisible to enemy radar. Its angular design, smooth surfaces, and radar-absorbent materials work to dramatically reduce its radar detection, allowing the aircraft to engage threats before ever being detected. The aircraft also hides its weapons in internal bays, avoiding the drag and radar signature caused by external mounts. Advanced infrared signature suppression further lowers the chance of heat-seeking missile detection. At the heart of its stealth strategy is the AN/APG-77 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which not only provides long-range tracking but also minimizes the chance of the aircraft giving away its position. To support the pilot during high-stress missions, the F-22 also provides pilot support and safety systems that monitor physical status and alertness. The systems track oxygen levels, G-forces, and signs of fatigue to help ensure the pilot remains fully conscious and in control, especially during high-speed or high-G manoeuvres. Combined with electronic warfare systems, sensor fusion, and low-probability-of-intercept communications, the F-22 can operate deep in contested airspace while remaining virtually undetectable—truly making it the most elusive and technologically advanced fighter jet ever built.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Development on the F-22 Raptor began in the early 1980s under the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, which aimed to create a next-generation air superiority fighter to replace the aging F-15 Eagle. After a competitive fly-off in 1991 between the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23, the YF-22 was decided as the winner due to its balanced combination of stealth, speed, and agility. Lockheed Martin, in partnership with Boeing and General Dynamics, went on to produce the F-22 Raptor, which officially entered service in 2005. Despite its unmatched performance, the program was limited by high costs and political pressures, resulting in a total production of just 187 operational aircraft. Its starting price for each jet was $334 million, and this was due to the cutting-edge technology it used. Still, the F-22 remains one of the most advanced and dominant fighter jets ever built, and it set the foundation for future stealth aircraft like the F-35.</p>
